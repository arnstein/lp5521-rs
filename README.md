# LP5521-rs

A minimal driver for the (pretty awesome) LP5521 LED driver!

## Current functionality

Currently this only supports setting the brightness on each of the channel and enabling/disabling the chip. I'm hoping to implement a way of writing programs for it as well, as the LP5521 has some pretty amazing programmability.
